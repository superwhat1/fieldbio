Project Proposal

How genetically diverse has the species become since it was introduced
Genetic/ phenotypic change over geographic distance(are the ones that live in a similar habitat as the original plants more similar)
How has the geographic distant affected the potential for herbivory and the genotype/phenotype 
Do the beetles have a prefered phenotype of the plant to feed on

Is there a minimum height for herbivory to start
Have the beetles been able to colonize the pesticide sprayed plants
